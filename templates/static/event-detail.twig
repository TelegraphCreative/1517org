                <p>What are the thoughts that run through your head as you read or sing this Psalm 51? Do you wonder if
                    you sing or pray them with enough contrition? Do you worry you lack a clean heart, a steadfast
                    spirit, the joy of salvation? </p>

                <p>When I used to sing <a href="#">these words</a>, I don’t think I was ever worried about being fully
                    cast from God’s presence, but I certainly worried I wasn’t good enough, whatever “good enough” was
                    supposed to be. Singing this hymn, I would close my eyes tight, praying away bad behaviors and
                    hoping God would finally scrub clean the corners of my heart. I saw my sin as final to-dos on a long
                    list of sanctification. They were annoying roadblocks, getting in my way from becoming better and
                    doing better. </p>

                <p>Yet Psalm 51 is much more than this one, <b>beautiful stanza</b>, and tells us much more about
                    ourselves and our sin than we would wish to be true. </p>

                <p>At the beginning of this psalm, David laments that it is against God and God alone that He has
                    sinned. This is interesting, especially considering the circumstances. King David has just slept
                    with a woman who is not his wife and had this woman’s husband killed so that he could do so. Surely
                    his sin was against others. Surely, he knows he has desperately failed at his to-do list. </p>

                <p>It’s not that David is <u>unrepentant</u> of the harm he has caused <strong>Bathsheba</strong>,
                    Uriah, and countless others. The point is that David is repenting of the sin that lies beneath these
                    actions, the sin all of us would rather avoid. He names this sin right after in verse 5: “I was
                    brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.” </p>

                <p>David confesses he is a sinner through and through. This sin is even deeper than the horror of murder
                    and deeper than the transgression of adultery because from here springs forth all unbelief, selfish
                    behavior and deceit. Each of us shares in this sin; the sin of self-justification and disbelief in
                    God’s promises. </p>

                    <li>List Item</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Yet Psalm 51 is much more than this one, beautiful stanza, and tells us much more about ourselves and
                    our sin than we would wish to be true. </p>

                <blockquote>
                    Forgiveness doesn’t fall out of the sky but is rooted in the death and resurrection of the one who
                    became sin for us.
                </blockquote>

                <p>Our hearts don’t just need to be cleansed of our bad behaviors; they need to be cleansed from the sin
                    in which, as fallen sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, we were conceived. Luther says it this way in
                    his Lectures on the Psalms, “The ungodly and proud man is, first of all, the excuser and defender,
                    the justifier and savior, of himself. For that very reason he automatically says that he does not
                    need God as his Savior.” </p>

                <p>As sinners, we will even use repentance as a means of self-justification. We turn the words of Psalm
                    51, or the practices during the season of Lent, into an announcement of how far we’ve justified
                    ourselves through our own works and penitence. We cannot be helped from doing so. </p>
